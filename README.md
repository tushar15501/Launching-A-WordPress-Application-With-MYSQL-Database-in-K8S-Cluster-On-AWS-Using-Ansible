central processing units (CPUs)
graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing
local/RAM memory
hard-disk/SSD storage
a choice of operating systems

What is Ansible ?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool, or platform, used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, intraservice orchestration, and provisioning.
Benefits of Using Ansible
Free: Ansible is an open-source tool.
Very simple to set up and use: No special coding skills are necessary to use Ansibleâ€™s playbooks (more on playbooks later).
Powerful: Ansible lets you model even highly complex IT workflows.
Flexible: You can orchestrate the entire application environment no matter where itâ€™s deployed. You can also customize it based on your needs.
Agentless: You donâ€™t need to install any other software or firewall ports on the client systems you want to automate. You also donâ€™t have to set up a separate management structure.
Efficient: Because you donâ€™t need to install any extra software, thereâ€™s more room for application resources on your server
